/** The screens each portal has, by URL path.
 *
 * Every portal is its own route group, and the group name never appears in
 * the address - so "/requests" belongs to the customer app, the reseller
 * portal and admin all at once. On a cold load (a refresh, a bookmark, a
 * pasted link) the router picks the first group that matches, which is
 * often the wrong one for whoever is signed in; RoleGuard then uses this
 * list to send them to the same screen in their own portal instead of
 * dumping them on their home page - see RoleGuard.
 *
 * Only fixed paths are listed. A screen with an id in it (request/[id],
 * order/[id]) is left out on purpose: the same id rarely means the same
 * thing in two portals, so those fall back to home.
 *
 * Keep in step with the files under app/(role)/ - a missing entry only
 * costs a redirect to home, a wrong one lands on an unknown route. */
